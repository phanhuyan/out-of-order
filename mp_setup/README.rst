Introduction
============

Welcome to ECE 411! In this MP, you will set up your environment for the coming MPs this semester.
This document will go over how you can work on this course's MPs remotely by connecting to EWS.

Environment Setup
=================

We are using the Synopsys toolchain for all MPs in this course. These tools are not available to be
setup on your own machine. You will need to use EWS to access these tools.

You have two options for your remote work environment setup: FastX or SSH with X-Forwarding.
Once you are able to connect remotely to an EWS machine you can move on to the next section.

FastX pros:

- Easy to setup
- Higher framerate
- Even works in browser
- Works well under network with high latency and/or low bandwidth
- Usually performs better than SSH with X-Forwarding

SSH with X-Forwarding pros:

- Sharper image, native resolution
- Sometimes performs better than FastX if you are using Linux

You can also use any EWS Linux machine on campus.

FastX
-----

EWS has a remote X desktop set up for students. There are two ways to access FastX: either through a web
browser at **fastx.ews.illinois.edu** or by downloading a client and connecting to FastX through there. If you are choosing to
use FastX for your work environment, we recommend downloading the client as opposed to using the web browser. The
instructions and download for the client can be found `here <https://answers.uillinois.edu/illinois.engineering/81727>`_.
If you have issues with FastX, please contact engineering IT by means listed `here <https://engrit.illinois.edu/contact-us>`_.


SSH with X-Forwarding
---------------------

EWS has set up a couple of servers that students can access over SSH. You can reach these using your favorite
SSH client by connecting to the EWS SSH server **linux.ews.illinois.edu**.

Almost all students have found that having a graphical Verdi waveform is useful. You may be the same,
in which case you may want to set up X-forwarding. Many SSH clients already include a built-in local X server. Some SSH
clients, however, require installing and configuring a local X server separately.

If you are using X-forwarding, please turn on compression (option ``-C`` in command line) in SSH, as X-forwarding
requires huge amount of bandwidth for Verdi. In real practice, SSH compression can reduce a huge
fraction of bandwidth use (~300 Mbps to ~10 Mbps from our experiences).

Windows
~~~~~~~
Here are some SSH clients, X servers, and tools on Windows:

- MobaXterm (SSH client with built-in X server)
- PuTTY (SSH client)
- SecureCRT (SSH client)
- Xming (X server)
- WinSCP (File management for FTP, SFTP, SSH)

We recommend using MobaXterm, as installation is simple and it already includes a built-in X server. If you would
like to use MobaXterm as your SSH client, follow these instructions.

Navigate `here <https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download-home-edition.html>`_ and follow the instructions to download and
install MobaXterm.

After installation, open MobaXterm. You should see the following window:

.. _Figure 1:
.. figure:: doc/figures/mobaxterm1.png
   :align: center
   :width: 80%
   :alt: MobaXterm

   Figure 1: MobaXterm
  
You can start a local terminal by clicking **Start local terminal** or by clicking the **+** sign by the Home tab.
In this terminal you can connect to EWS with (replacing ``NETID`` with your NETID)::

    $ ssh -CY NETID@linux.ews.illinois.edu

``-X`` enables X-forwarding and ``-C`` turns on compression for X-forwarding. You will be prompted for your password.
After that, you should be connected to EWS with X-forwarding enabled.

Mac
~~~

On Mac, we recommend using XQuartz as your local X-server. You can download and install Xquartz `here <https://www.xquartz.org/>`_.

Once installed, start the application XQuartz and open a terminal by selecting **Applications â†’ Terminal**. You can also use MacOS's
own terminal.

.. _Figure 2:
.. figure:: doc/figures/XQuartz1.png
   :align: center
   :width: 80%
   :alt: XQuartz

   Figure 2: XQuartz

Now, you can SSH into EWS by running (replacing ``NETID`` with your NETID)::
   
    $ ssh -CY NETID@linux.ews.illinois.edu
   
After this, you should be connected to EWS with X-forwarding enabled.

Linux
~~~~~
Simply run (replacing ``NETID`` with your NETID)::

    $ ssh -CY NETID@linux.ews.illinois.edu

And it should be good to go now.

You can read about the difference between ``-X`` and ``-Y`` `here <https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ssh.1.html>`_.
We have observed that some features of Verdi such as zooming the wave window using mouse wheels might not work
if using untrusted X-Forwarding (``-X``). Please consider using trusted X-Forwarding (``-Y``) if you encounter those issues.

Creating a Github Repository
============================

SSH Key
-------

We highly recommend setting up public key authentication with GitHub so you do not have to type your password everytime you commit your code.
If you have already done this or you wish not to use this method, jump to the next seciton.

You can create a public key for your SSH client by running the following::

    $ ssh-keygen -t ed25519
    > Enter a file in which to save the key (~/.ssh/id_ed25519): [press enter]
    > Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [type passphrase, or leave empty and press enter.]
    > Enter same passphrase again: [type same passphrase again]
    $ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
    $ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

Print your public key to the terminal so you can copy it and add it to your Github::
   
    $ cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

Navigate `here <https://github.com/settings/keys>`_ and you should see the following web page:

.. figure:: doc/figures/ssh_keys.png
   :align: center
   :width: 80%
   :alt: SSH and GPG keys

   Figure 3: SSH and GPG keys
  
Select **New SSH Key** and type in a descriptive title. Paste your copied public key into the **key** field:

.. figure:: doc/figures/new_ssh.png
   :align: center
   :width: 80%
   :alt: Enter your new SSH key.

Click on configure SSO and authorize illinois-cs-coursework.

Illinois CS Network GitHub Repository
-------------------------------------

To create your Git repository, go to `<https://edu.cs.illinois.edu/create-gh-repo/sp24_ece411>`_.
The page will guide you through the setup of connecting your github.com account and your Illinois NETID.
You will need a github.com account in order to create the course repository. Please follow all the instructions on the link above.

Next, create a directory to contain your ECE 411 files (this will include subdirectories for each
MP, so chose a name such as ``ece411``) and execute the following commands (replacing ``NETID`` with
your NETID)::

  $ git init
  $ git remote add origin git@github.com:illinois-cs-coursework/sp24_ece411_NETID.git
  $ git remote add release git@github.com:illinois-cs-coursework/sp24_ece411_.release.git
  $ git pull origin main
  $ git branch -m main
  $ git fetch release
  $ git merge --allow-unrelated-histories release/mp_setup -m "Merging provided mp_setup files"
  $ git push --set-upstream origin main

If you have not set up SSH access to your github account, you may encounter an error similar to the following figure.

Testing Your Software
=====================

To setup the software and environment variables for this class, run the following command::

    $ source /class/ece411/ece411.sh

You will need to run this command every time you log on to EWS. Alternatively you can add it to your bashrc::

    $ echo 'source /class/ece411/ece411.sh' >> ~/.bashrc

VCS
---

We use Synopsys VCS to simulate our designs in this course. After cloning mp_setup and setting up the class environment,
from the ``sim`` folder, run::

    $ make sim/alu_tb

This will invoke the Synopsys VCS compiler, which build a simulation binary using the RTL design in ``hdl`` and the testbench in ``hvl``.::

    $ make run_alu_tb

This will run the simulation.
The simulation will dump all signals in a fast signal database (FSDB) file.

We recommend you open up and read the Makefile if you would like to know what exactly the two make target commands were doing.

Verdi
-----

Verdi is Synopsys's waveform viewer and debugger. We use it to inspect signals inside our design.
To view the signal dump from the simulation that you just ran::

    $ make verdi


.. _Figure 7:
.. figure:: doc/figures/verdi.png
   :align: center
   :width: 80%
   :alt: Verdi window.

   Figure 7: Verdi

You can navigate the design hierarchy on the instance window on the left. Double clicking on an instance opens up the block's code in the source browser window.
Select any signal name in the source browser window and press ``Ctrl + 4`` or ``Ctrl + w`` to add it to the waveform viewer.

While a signal is selected, you can click on the driver or load buttons on the toolbar (with D and L as their logos respectively) to go to the source or destination
of the selected signal.

A complete user guide to Verdi can be found on EWS::

    $ $VERDI_HOME/doc/verdi.pdf

Design Compiler
---------------

Synopsys Design Compiler is an RTL synthesis tool. A synthesis tool converts an RTL circuit specification into logic gates and flip-flops. It uses pieces available
in a standard cell library as building blocks. In ECE 411, we will use FreePDK45 as our target technology.
In the real world, the PDK or Process Design Kit is usually supplied by a semiconductor fabrication company.

The synthesis tcl scripts have been set up for you.

To synthesize the mp_setup design, in the ``synth`` folder, run::

    $ make synth

Generated reports, including area and timing, are in ``synth/reports``.

The area report will be an estimate of how much physical space a design will occupy in square micrometers.
The timing report will show the longest path delay in the design and whether it meets the timing requirement
imposed by the target clock frequency (There is no target clock frequency in this example design).

Spyglass
--------

Spyglass is the linting tool. It will look at your source RTL code and report any potential problems in your design. 

To lint the mp_setup design, in the ``lint`` folder, run::

    $ make lint

Generated reports are in ``lint/reports``.

The main report to look at is ``lint/reports/lint.rpt``. The specific report for this design should show no problems.
You will get a better sense of how to use these tools later in the semester.


Deliverables
============

There are no deliverables for this MP. However, it is essential that you go through the steps listed here
to setup your development environment and understand the tools being used.

We encourage you to look at the provided scripts and Makefile, and post any questions about the tools to Campuswire.
